# Flex Tool Bar

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cakecatz/flex-toolbar.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/cakecatz/flex-toolbar)

## About

This is a plugin for
the [Atom Tool Bar](https://atom.io/packages/tool-bar) package.

You can configure your toolbar buttons with a `CSON`, `JSON`, `JSON5` file
to perform specific actions in Atom
or to open web sites in your default browser.

To edit your config file,
type `Flex Tool Bar: Edit Config File` in the Atom command palette.

## Configuration

**Flex Tool Bar** has four `type`s you can configure:
`button`, `url`, `file` and `spacer`.

-   `button` creates default buttons for your toolbar.

    You can use it to set actions like `application:new-file`.

-   `url` creates buttons pointing to specific web pages.

    Use this to open any web site, such as your GitHub notifications,
    in your default browser. See this feature in action in this [screencast](http://quick.as/b5vafe4g).

    If you have the package [browser-plus](https://atom.io/packages/browser-plus)
    installed, you can use it to open your links.
    Just check the box in Flex Tool Bar's settings.

    Also Atom URI are allowed. For example
    `atom://config/packages/flex-tool-bar` will open Flex Tool Bar's settings.

-   `file` creates buttons pointing to specific files that will be opened in Atom.

    You can use it to open files of nearly any kind that Atom supports, such as logs, configs or simply a project's `README.md`.

-   `spacer` adds separators between toolbar buttons.

### Features

-   multiple callback
-   button style
-   hide/disable a button in certain cases

### Button style

Can use CSS Property.

```coffeescript
style: {
  color: "red"
  background: "green"
  border: "1px solid blue"
}
```

### Multiple callback

```coffeescript
callback: ["callback1", "callback2"]
```

### Hide(Show), Disable(Enable) button

You can hide or disable buttons when a certain grammar is
used in the active file or a specified file is matched.

If you set `disable` (`show`, `hide` or `enable`) this way:

```coffeescript
disable: "coffee"
```

It will disable the button if a CoffeeScript file is open.

You can also look for a specific file using [globs](https://tr.im/glob):

```coffeescript
show: {
  pattern: 'gulpfile.js'
  options: {
    maxDepth: 2
  }
}
```

The package uses [tree-match-sync](https://github.com/bored/tree-match-sync)
that depends on the `tree` command, [install it](https://github.com/bored/tree-match-sync#installation)
before using this feature.

The options are explained [here](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch#options)
and it has an extra field: `maxDepth`,
it translates to `tree`'s option `-L`, you should always set it.

Of course, you can set it as an array.

```coffeescript
disable: [
  "json"
  "less"
]
```

You can use `!` :laughing:

```coffeescript
hide: "!Markdown"
```

This will hide button when opened any file except Markdown.

```coffeescript
show: "Markdown"
```

This is same above.

### Example

```coffeescript
[
  {
    type: "url"
    icon: "octoface"
    url: "https://github.com/"
    tooltip: "Github Page"
  }
  {
    type: "spacer"
  }
  {
    type: "button"
    icon: "document"
    callback: "application:new-file"
    tooltip: "New File"
    iconset: "ion"
    mode: "dev"
  }
  {
    type: "button"
    icon: "columns"
    iconset: "fa"
    callback: ["pane:split-right", "pane:split-right"]
  }
  {
    type: "button"
    icon: "circuit-board"
    callback: "git-diff:toggle-diff-list"
    style:
      color: "#FA4F28"
  }
  {
    type: "button"
    icon: "markdown"
    callback: "markdown-preview:toggle"
    disable: "!markdown"
  }
  {
    type: "file"
    iconset: "fa"
    icon: "book"
    url: "README.md"
    tooltip: "View Documentation"
  }  
]
```
